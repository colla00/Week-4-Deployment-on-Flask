# Week 4 Deployment on Flask

In this week, we deploy a machine learning model (SVM) using the Flask Framework. As a demonstration, our model help to predict the spam and ham comment of YouTube. First, we build a machine learning model for YouTube Comments Spam Detection, then create an API for the model, using Flask, the Python micro-framework for building web applications. This API allows us to utilize predictive capabilities through HTTP requests.
