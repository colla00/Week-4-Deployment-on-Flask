# Week 4 Deployment on Flask

I deployed a machine learning model (SVM) this week using the Flask Framework. As a demonstration, our model helps to predict spam comments on YouTube. First, I built a machine learning model for YouTube Comments Spam Detection, then created an API for the model using Flask, the Python micro-framework for building web applications. This API allows me to utilize predictive capabilities through HTTP requests.
